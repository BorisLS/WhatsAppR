# WhatsAppR
[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) Messenger is a freeware instant messaging application for smartphones. By default, this provides the function of exporting the history of a chat as txt-file. The **WhatsAppR**-package allows you to import your exported WhatsApp chat history in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).

The **WhatsAppR**-packages also provides some basic funtions for analysing the chat history.

The package is currently under development.

**Note**: Only German language is supported! For supporting English language some chat histories from smartphones with 'english-settings' are requested for testing and development!
